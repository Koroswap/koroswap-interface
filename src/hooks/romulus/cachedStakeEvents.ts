        "UBE:1\n\nPROPOSAL: \nThis proposal codifies which Ubeswap pairs, staked as ULP tokens, will be incentivized with UBE emissions and what the weight of each of those pairs will be. \n\nPURPOSE: \nThe purpose of this proposal is to provide staked ULP liquidity providers with a predictable rate of UBE emissions.\nPlanned Reward System:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fdO_oXxS4xJzRj_m3GX8Uv_Dtf3_NM2EWrwEwM-lywI/edit?usp=sharing\n\nRATIONALE: \nSudden changes to emissions rates impact liquidity provider returns. \nCodifying which and how much staked ULP tokens will be incentivized gives liquidity providers assurances regarding the percentage of UBE to expect. \nFormalizing UBE emissions via Ubeswap governance gives the community of UBE owners transparency in the decision making process and the ability to express their support or lack their of via formal vote.\n\n\nHere are the steps to delegate your UBE votes either to yourself or someone else: \n1. Go to https://romulus.page/\n2. Click ‘Connect Wallet’ \n3. Select your Wallet and Connect (you should see your address in the upper right hand corner once you've connected)\n4. Click ‘Start Voting’\n5. Click ‘Ubeswap’\n6. If you're holding UBE, then under ‘User Details’ click ‘Change’. (note: you'll need to unstake and remove liquidity from any pair to delegate). \n7. Paste the address in the ‘Delegate Address’ box. The address can be your own address that is holding the UBE or it can be someone else's address if you wish to delegate your voting authority. \n8. Click ‘Delegate’ and sign the transaction\n",

        "Poof.cash had a bug in its dual staking contract that caused funds to be locked: https://twitter.com/PoofCash/status/1427812355568816136\n\nIn an effort to return lost funds to the users in this dual staking pool, we are proposing to reimburse the UBE portion of the funds locked in the contract with 400K UBE from the Partnership and Ecosystem allocation. The requested UBE will go into a multisig controlled by Brian and Ian who will move the funds into a refund contract after it is audited and deployed. The refund contract will allow a user to claim an amount of UBE equal to their locked UBE tokens along with additional UBE tokens to compensate for lost rewards stemming from their locked LP tokens.\n\nHere are a few additional reasons to consider supporting this proposal:\n\n- Users who risked their funds in the POOF<>UBE dual staking contract helped discover a vulnerability that we're now aware of with all the staking contracts on Ubeswap\n- The UBE used for this proposal doesn't inflate the total circulating supply of UBE. Since UBE is permanently locked up in the POOF<>UBE dual staking contract, UBE from this proposal replaces the UBE that was lost in that pool. The permanently locked LP tokens will continue to provide liquidity between POOF and UBE forever.\n- A parallel proposal on Poof.cash (http://poof.cash/) will also be made to return 2.5M POOF tokens back to the impacted users",

        'UIP 4 UBESWAP - Prosperity for all \n\nProposal to donate 0.01% of swaps to impactmarket. This will impact 20% of the 0.05% of swaps that are currently bought back to the community fund. It is proposed that the donation is made in UBE, and held in UBE with the Impact Market DAO, and converted to cUSD only when their communities are experiencing a shortage of UBI funding. The donation is supposed to help communities in need. Thus we will align Ubeswap with one of the core principals and the DNA of Celo as a blockchain "Prosperity for all". \n\nIt is possible, that the Ube treasury will receive IPCT tokens for governing ImpactMarket, for the donations made through this proposal. It is proposed, that 75% of those tokens will be shared as rewards for single staking UBE, if that feature goes live within the next 6 months. This would benefit ImpactMarket, as the ICPT token would become more widely distributed. The single staking UBE feature is a highly desired option by our community, and the possibility of earning other tokens through this feature would make UBE even more attractive.\nPart of this proposal is to set up a counter/ticker somewhere on the website, so UBEswap users can see how much has been donated. \n\nIn the beginning, the donations will be performed manually on a monthly basis. However, it is expected that the donations will be automated, as soon as the engineering team is ready, and preferably once the IPCT token goes  live. \n\nThe program will go into effect for 1year, with the option for the community to cancel or modify earlier through a governance vote. After 1 year this proposal will be reevaluated with the expectation that if it is extended via governance then it will be extended for a much longer period so that we don\'t have to circle back to the same vote topic.\n',

More projects are launching soon.\n3) Incentivize pools that bring on net-new liquidity. (e.g. WETH which can now be bridged over from Ethereum)\n\nWith the new distributions attached, I propose to add back the unallocated UBE to the UBE-CELO pool. This is the best option that doesn't require engineering effort. Given the demand for UBE single staking, this can be a future option for spare UBE. However, UBE single staking hasn't been built out yet.\n\nThe cETH and cBTC pool incentives have been dropped completely. I propose this to make room for bridged assets from Ethereum and because their volume is so low relative to liquidity. There is fear that cETH and cBTC liquidity could move, however, a large portion of cETH has stayed outside of the farming pool since launch. This liquidity seems stagnant and we've already reduced rewards here once with little to no change in liquidity. Rewarding bridged assets from Ethereum should net out more liquidity given the nature of the cBTC and cETH liquidity present.",

        "UIP-6: UBE Distribution Optimizations (Single Staking + Generalized Rewards Framework):\n\nProposed by @ninthstate with input from the Ubeswap team.\n\nWhat?\nThis is a proposal to create a (1) generalized framework for UBE distributions to pools and to (2) add in UBE single staking, which has been supported and discussed at length among the Ubeswap Discord community and core team since April 2021. \n\nWhen?\nUBE rewards will be halved in October 2021 (around the 21st). All changes proposed would correspond with the UBE rewards halving to help offset that change and continue to reward UBE holders at a similar level.\n\n\nGeneralized framework for UBE distributions:\n1) A pairing becomes eligible for UBE rewards if the community approves of it. Until the voting process is less burdensome (currently takes 8 days and 2M in quorum on a delegate snapshot), community approval will be gauged by discussions on the Discord with moderators and core team members serving as the judge of sentiment. When voting is more feasible on small matters like token eligibility, the community will vote directly on which pairings are eligible.\n2) Once a pair is selected to have UBE rewards, the dynamic framework outlined in this proposal will adjust rewards automatically. To start, pools will be eligible for up to 1% of distributions and after that pool rewards will be based on category, Liquidity, 7-Day Volume, and the ratio between the two. If a pool becomes un-useful along two of the three current metrics, rewards can be dropped. Pools can also be hard-capped on a case-by-case basis if the reason is justified and shared beforehand (e.g. rCELO-CELO is capped at 1% since large trades can stake / unstake with ~0 slippage it's basically a single token pool, and USDC-CELO capped at 3% will ensure USD stablecoin liquidity is not fractionalized on Ubeswap). Category bucket minimums and maximums will change dynamically based on the number of pairs in each bucket and at the discretion of the community and team. If a team wants to re-allocate or move their UBE rewards to a different pool, they are allowed to do so. The new pool will be re-categorized and eligible for the transitioned rewards initially, but rewards will be re-calculated for that new pool independently moving forward.\n\n\nUBE single staking:\n-5% initial distribution, will be managed by generalized framework in future weeks depending on liquidity response\n-Stretch goal: give users the chance to vote on Ubeswap proposals while staking\n\n\nFull details:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1WWpcSRmkACLVqwtkbpDO6-NmQcB_SAOuwUQ_9Tu-1Ic/edit\n",

        'UIP8 - Buyback UBE with all locked UIP-2 related swap fees and move to the final Community Fund\n\nBackground: When UIP-2 passed on 08/20/21, the ubeswap community approved a UBE buyback from 0.05% of all trading fees. The fees were directed to a community-controlled time-locked governance treasury (by Brian) through 11/05/21. (https://discord.com/channels/810260687354855454/810260687354855457/906271301818257519) \n\nAfter that date, the fees were sent to an Ubeswap contract that swaps the LP tokens back to UBE, where they now reside: https://romulus.page/ubeswap/buyback\n\nThe funds that have been swapped to the Community Fund so far, according to UIP-2 completion, can be found here: https://explorer.celo.org/address/0x97A9681612482A22b7877afbF8430EDC76159Cae/tokens \n\nRomulus only allows 10 TXs to be submitted per proposal. To account for that limit, an evaluation of the point-in-time value of the ULP tokens in the community fund [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LVa1l-XyzYUWrH3TNG0QKo8ragoBWXL9-dDDLTCqu-c/edit#gid=0] found that these ULP tokens are the 10 most valuable pairs to swap to UBE, which captures the majority of the value:\n0xf5b1bc6c9c180b64f5711567b1d6a51a350f8422\n0x27616d3dba43f55279726c422daf644bc60128a8\n0x427c95a1379182121791cc415125acd73ea02e97\n0xb5108b01280f994e67dc8bc3cd1e2433fa3a1b41\n0xe7b5ad135fa22678f426a381c7748f6a5f2c9e6c\n0x83cf02f79be87a7402a3cac013d0e1c95fefcaba\n0x1e593f1fe7b61c53874b54ec0c59fd0d5eb8621e\n0x0b81cf47c8f97275d14c006e537d5101b6c87300\n0x58fff7110e39c733fd37742b8850f9205fbc351b\n0x69d5646e63c7ce63171f76eba89348b52c1d552c\n\nHowever, many of these pairings are deprecated (e.g. Moola V1 tokens). So in order to avoid significant slippage, these ULP tokens will be sent to a Ubeswap core team multisig [0x9eb32a2962f006bD6F8357ae7AB0954e9999fC15] for the purpose of buying back UBE at random intervals over a 30 day window (starting the day this proposal is passed) and sending the bought-back UBE to the community fund.',

        'UIP-13\n\nEnable cross-chain swaps on Ubeswap via the Squid Widget.\n\nThe Celo ecosystem has dearly needed cross-chain swap capability for onboarding of users into the ecosystem. Axelar and Squid have built single click swaps from any token on other chains to any token on Celo. The mechanism for this is by bridging axlUSDC across to Celo, swapping to cUSD on Curve, then immediately swapping to CELO or another Celo asset on Ubeswap, as per the liquidity model here. Squid has completed integrations for V2 liquidity and V3-style concentrated liquidity, which Ubeswap has just released.\n\nThe integration\nSquid has built a front end widget which allows any of their partner DEXs to enable cross-chain swaps through their liquidity pools with as little code as possible. You can try it at the Squid Widget Studio here.\n\nThe Squid team has made a pull request to add this widget to the Ubeswap site. This adds a Cross chain Swap tab, where users can swap into or out of Celo. Swaps will be routed through Ubeswap’s pools wherever possible.\nhttps://github.com/Ubeswap/ubeswap-interface/pull/675\n\nBenefits\n- Increased volume on Ubeswap’s pools\n- Easier onboarding of users into Ubeswap and into Celo\n- Easier access to the Celo ecosystem for yield-seeking capital\n- Solidifying Ubeswap as a hub for the Celo ecosystem\n- Ubeswap is the first site which users visit when they start exploring Celo\n\nWhat is Squid\nSquid allows any token to be swapped between blockchains, and unlocks access to apps across chains in a single click. Use Squid to build seamless user experiences that tap into cross-chain liquidity and scale to reach anyone with a crypto wallet, no matter what chain they’re on.\n\nWhat is Axelar\nAxelar delivers secure interchain communication. That means dApp users can interact with any asset, any application, on any chain, with one click. You can think of it as Stripe for Web3. Developers interact with a simple API atop a permissionless network that routes messages and ensures network security via proof-of-stake consensus.\n\nHow to participate\nStake your UBE at https://app.ubeswap.org/#/stake and vote FOR on this proposal. Voting does not affect your token balance.',

It will refresh rewards for the next 3 years and have a designated allocation for marketing/listing expenses. \nMax UBE supply will increase to 250,000,000. However, only 111,000,000 ube will be in circulation in TGE and the rest will be vested through 3 years. \nNew UBE token contract will be created, and holders will switch to new UBE by swapping their tokens within the allocated time. A snapshot will be taken, and all holders will receive 1:1,5 UBE when swapping. There will be no vesting in token swaps.\nDAO Treasury will increase to 7,500,000 UBE and the current DAO Treasury LP in the Celo-UBE pool will be withdrawn to create a new LP with the new UBE token. This will be the initial LP and as the liquidity increases the tokens will be returned to the DAO treasury. The initial price of UBE will be the same as the old UBE on the date of snapshot. \nAll current mechanism in the platform (buyback, stake and governance) will work same as usual under the new UBE contract.',
